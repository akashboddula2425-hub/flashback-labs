Design a clean, minimalist mobile application that enables users to authenticate via OTP, perform a liveness check, capture a selfie, and upload it securely. The user journey begins with a welcoming screen featuring a simple layout: a logo or icon at the top, a title ("Welcome"), an input field for the phone number in E.164 format, and a "Send OTP" button, which remains disabled until a valid number is entered. Clear microcopy below the input field instructs users that the OTP will be sent via WhatsApp. Upon requesting the OTP, the user transitions to the OTP Verification screen, where they enter a 6-digit code displayed in separate input boxes with auto-tab functionality. The screen includes a "Verify" button, a "Resend OTP" option, and feedback for any validation errors. Once verified, users proceed to the Liveness Detection screen, which uses the front camera in a circular frame and guides users through simple steps like blinking or turning their head. Visual feedback, such as animated borders and status messages ("Detecting…" or "Liveness Passed"), enhances the experience. Only upon successful liveness detection does the "Capture Selfie" button activate. Users can then preview the captured selfie, with options to "Retake" or "Upload" it. A subtle message assures them that the upload is secure. Finally, the Welcome screen displays a confirmation message with the verified phone number and uploaded selfie in a circular frame, along with a "Logout" or "Go to Home" button. The UI maintains a consistent minimalist design, using a limited color palette—dark gray or black as primary (#0D0D0D), white as secondary (#FFFFFF), an accent color like blue (#007AFF) or green (#10B981), and red (#EF4444) for errors. Typography relies on system fonts, using bold titles (20–24pt), regular body text (14–16pt), and medium-weight buttons (16pt). UI elements provide appropriate visual and haptic feedback, with subtle transitions like fade-ins or slide-ins to enhance UX. The layout is fully responsive, compatible with all screen sizes using flexible layout techniques, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience from OTP entry to selfie upload.
